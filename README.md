## Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I'm Rebecca.

<!--
**fenris55/fenris55** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
Iâ€™m a fullstack engineer based in Chattanooga, TN. I recently created [Flytrap](https://getflytrap.github.io/), an open-source, self-hosted error monitoring software for web applications. It's a lightweight error monitoring solution that uses Terraform to provision directly on your AWS account, so you maintain control of your data, your infrastructure, and your error monitoring costs. 

You can check out the Flytrap [case study](https://getflytrap.github.io/case-study) to learn more.
