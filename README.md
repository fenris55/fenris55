## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rebecca.

ðŸ’» Iâ€™m a fullstack engineer based in Chattanooga, TN. 

ðŸŒ± I recently created [Flytrap](https://getflytrap.github.io/), an open-source, self-hosted error monitoring software for web applications. It uses Terraform for automated architecture provisioning directly on your AWS account, so you maintain control of your data, your infrastructure, and your error monitoring costs. Flytrap: catching bugs so you don't have to. 

ðŸ“— You can check out the Flytrap [case study](https://getflytrap.github.io/case-study) to learn more.
